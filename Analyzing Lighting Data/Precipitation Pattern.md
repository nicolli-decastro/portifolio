# Fire Analysis: Investigating Precipitation Patterns on Fire Sizes Caused by Lighting Strike
Welcome to this analytical exploration that dives into the intriguing relationship between precipitation patterns, lightning strikes, and subsequent fire events. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, this project seeks to discern how varying precipitation patterns might affect the sizes of fires ignited by lightning.

## Highlights:
- **Dataset Depth:** This project analyzes a dataset that merges fire events with associated lightning strikes, focusing on lightning occurrences within a 3 km radius of a fire's starting point.
- **Visualization:** Through a series of histograms, box plots, and heatmaps, the data's multifaceted relationships are uncovered.
- **Duplicate Management:** Data preprocessing steps ensure the dataset's integrity by handling and removing duplicates effectively.
- **Unit Conversion & Data Management:** Flexibility in handling precipitation data, including conversion between inches and millimeters, allowing for a universal understanding of precipitation patterns.

## Technical Prerequisites and Libraries:
- **Python**: 3.x
- **Essential Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow 2.x, and more.

## How It Works:
1. **Google Colab Adaptability**: The script self-detects if it's running on Google Colab, subsequently mounting Google Drive and adjusting libraries as needed.
2. **Data Assimilation**: Seamlessly imports datasets from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
3. **Robust Data Cleansing**: Identifies, count, and eliminate duplicates based on unique parameters ensuring an untainted data set for accurate inference.
4. **Visualization Spectrum**: From visualizing precipitation distributions related to all fire classes to examining lightning strikes by the hour, the visual narratives are comprehensive and insightful.
5. **Heatmap Generators**: Prepare the stage for heatmap visualizations, emphasizing the interplay between lightning strikes, hours of the day, and varying precipitation levels.

## Portfolio Context:
This project exemplifies the application of data analysis and visualization techniques to real-world datasets. The primary aim is to uncover the intricate relationships between weather conditions and fire events cause by lighting strikes.
